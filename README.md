**The Strategy pattern** defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.

- ##### Principle 2: Program to an interface, not an implementation
- ##### Principle 3: Favor composition over inheritance
